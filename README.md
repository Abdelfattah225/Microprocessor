# Microprocessor
<h3>building a complete Intel 8086-based microcomputer.</h3>

- ðŸ”§ Clock Generator: Designing and implementing a clock generator circuit with the 8284 clock generator.

- ðŸ”— Buffering and Address Scan: Connecting and buffering CPU buses for interfacing, and understanding the principal operation cycles of the CPU.

- ðŸ’¾ Memory Interfacing: Connecting non-volatile EEPROM memory to execute stored software.

- ðŸ”Œ Input/Output Interfacing: Interfacing input and output units with the CPU to interact with external devices.

- These experiments not only enhanced our understanding of microprocessor architecture and interfacing but also provided hands-on experience with both hardware and software aspects of embedded systems.
